FontBuddy
=========

Because putting text on the screen in XNA/MonoGame shouldn't so hard, gosh darn it!

This is pretty simple to use... you create one of these things, load up a font into it, and draw some text.

When you draw text you can choose how to justify it, and can even draw SHAKY TEXT oooohhhh

Cheers!
