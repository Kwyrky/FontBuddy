FontBuddy
=========

Because putting text on the screen in XNA/MonoGame shouldn't so hard, gosh darn it!

This is pretty simple to use... you create one of these things, load up a font into it, and draw some text.  When you draw text you can choose how to justify it, makes it waaay easier to line up your text with other stuff.

Some of these have some different parameters that you might want to tweak, like where the shadow are positioned or speed or whatever.

Some of the different font effects are shadow text, pulsating text, shaky text, opposite text, and rainbow text.  These are all pretty simple, there's no shader magic or nothing going on.

Cheers!
